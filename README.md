ðŸ“˜ The Dungeons & Dragons Exploit Codex \- Rules-as-Written (**RAW**) versus Rules-as-Intended (**RAI**)\!

---

I'm collecting these exploits in this [Codex](https://github.com/EvilSupahFly/DnD-Rule-Abuse/blob/main/CODEX.md), though it's still a rough draft, with some duplicated sections and things out of order, but here's a glimpse. I think you'll like the rest.

## **Rules Arbitration Busters & DM Headache Triggers**

---

### **Rule 1: *"The DM is always right"  \-  But only when they actually enforce it***

Exploit: Exploit inconsistent rulings by taking advantage of the "spirit of the rules" when the DM forgets or contradicts themselves. If they don't catch your edge-case, run with it.

### **Rule 2: *Infinite Action Loops***

Exploit: Combining *Haste*, *Action Surge*, *Ready* actions, and *bonus actions* (via feats or class features) can create absurd loops. RAW doesn't always say how many actions can be readied and triggered simultaneously. Find the chain and break the action economy.

### **Rule 3: *"You can cast spells while grappling if you don't use a spell attack or require somatic components"***

Exploit: Use spells that require only verbal or material components (without somatic) while grappled to keep control, stunlock, or debuff opponents without letting go.

### **Rule 4: *Healing Overflow & Potion Glut***

Exploit: Use the combination of *Healer* feat, potions, and abilities like *Song of Rest* to infinitely boost HP or remove conditions. Take turns chugging potions mid-combat to cheese fights.

### **Rule 5: *Talk Yourself Out of the Dungeon***

Exploit: Abuse social skill checks, combined with *Friends* cantrip and *Vicious Mockery*, to demoralize NPCs and avoid combat entirely  \-  or turn enemies into your unwitting allies.

### **Rule 6: *Corner Case Language in Feats***

Exploit: Take feats like *Lucky* or *Shield Master* to "bend" initiative or saving throws, or use *Sentinel* and *Polearm Master* for forced reaction damage every turn.

### **Rule 7: *Rule Zero for Maximum Chaos***

Exploit: Use the vague "Rule Zero" principle itself as a weapon: threaten to call out inconsistent rulings or demand explicit rules on the spot, slowing down the game and grinding the table to a halt.

### **Rule 8: *Stacking Conditions for Maximum Debuff***

Exploit: Stack effects like *Frightened*, *Restrained*, *Prone*, and *Grappled* in combinations that don't explicitly state they override or cancel each other, effectively locking down foes for multiple rounds.

### **Rule 9: *Long Rest Abuse***

Exploit: Exploit the RAW wording on long rests to repeatedly gain all spell slots, class features, and hit points with minimal downtime. Combine with *Teleporter* or *Spell Scroll* to bypass travel or encounter limits.
