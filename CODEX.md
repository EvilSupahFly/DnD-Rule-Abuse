### **🪙 *Infinite Wishes via Simulacrum***

### **🪤 *Snare \+ Alarm \+ Familiar \= Auto-Counter Ambush***

Exploit: Place *Snare* and *Alarm* on choke points, then use your familiar to bait enemies in. As soon as the trap springs, you get alerted and start your ambush with Advantage while they're restrained.

---

### **🪞 *Simulacrum \+ Magic Mirror \= Infinite Surveillance***

Exploit: Cast *Scrying* or *Arcane Eye* via your Simulacrum while you take a nap. Your clone doesn't need rest, so you now have 24/7 magical recon and counter-spy coverage.

---

### **🧊 *Wall of Ice \+ Shatter \= Instant AOE Nuke***

Exploit: Cast *Wall of Ice* to trap or surround enemies, then *Shatter* the wall. RAW, *Wall of Ice* has HP and can be damaged \- breaking it causes piercing damage to nearby creatures. Shatter gives you control over that burst. Bonus points if they're already restrained.

---

## **🧠 Meta Magic & Multiclass Mayhem**

---

### **🧬 *Twinned Polymorph – Double Trouble***

Exploit: Sorcerers can Twin Polymorph to affect two allies at once. Turn both into T-Rexes or storm elementals. Now you have a kaiju tag-team.

### **🗡 *Booming Blade \+ War Caster \+ Sentinel \= No Escape***

Exploit: With War Caster and Sentinel, opportunity attacks can be Booming Blade. If the target moves, they take bonus damage. If they don't, they're stuck. Catch-22 with sparkles.

### **💫 *Divine Smite \+ Critical Hit \= Nova Strike***

Exploit: Paladin crits with a melee attack? You can dump all your highest-level spell slots into Divine Smite. No action required. Drop a smite bomb instantly.

### **👑 *Pact of the Chain \+ Voice of the Chain Master***

Exploit: Warlocks can perceive through their familiar at any range using Voice of the Chain Master. Spy across the world, scout dungeons, or deliver touch spells \- no limits.

### **🕷 *Spider Climb \+ Melee \= Rooftop Murderer***

Exploit: Cast Spider Climb and walk on ceilings. Enemies without ranged attacks can't hit you. Combine with polearm reach and laugh from above.

---

## **📦 Environmental & Physics Shenanigans**

---

### **🧯 *Create Bonfire \+ Oil \= Budget Napalm***

Exploit: Drop oil from a flask, then cast Create Bonfire. Now you've got magical fire that sticks, spreads, and auto-reignites every turn.

### **🚿 *Decanter of Endless Water – Water Cannon***

Exploit: "Geyser" mode pushes creatures 30 feet. Mount the decanter on a cart or harness. Now you've got a fantasy firehose that can knock foes off cliffs.

### **🧺 *Shrink Item \+ Time Stop \= Bomb Squad***

Exploit: Shrink large objects with *Enlarge/Reduce* or *Magic Item: Folding Boat*, then carry them. During Time Stop, throw them and drop the effect \- instant obstacles, traps, or damage.

---

## **💪 Exploits of Strength & Stupidity**

---

### **🪵 *Ladder Pole Vault (Improvised Siege)***

Exploit: RAW, you can wield any object as an improvised weapon. That includes ladders, trees, or tavern doors. Drop a 10-foot ladder on someone for shenanigans \- or pole vault over walls using Jump.

### **🐄 *Catapult \+ Livestock \= Tactical Cow***

Exploit: The Catapult spell launches "a nonmagical object weighing 1–5 pounds." Nothing says it *can't* be a chicken or rabbit. Launch explosive familiars or cursed items straight into enemy lines.

### **🧱 *Build-a-Prison: Immovable Rod Edition***

Exploit: Place an Immovable Rod in midair, then create a Wall of Force or Stone around it. Now you've got a floating, inescapable cell. Bonus: put the rod under a door to make it unopenable.

### **🎣 *Grappling Hook \+ Mage Hand \+ Levitate \= Batman Mode***

Exploit: Tie a rope to a grappling hook. Use Mage Hand to hook it onto something, then Levitate yourself. With the right setup, you're a medieval Spider-Man.

### **🧍 *Reduce \+ Halfling \= Pocket Rogue***

Exploit: Enlarge/Reduce cuts a creature's size by half. Use on a halfling to create a 1-foot-tall rogue who fits through mouse holes. Great for infiltration or freaking out guards.

### **🔔 *Alarm \+ Permanent Magic \= Infinite Doorbell***

Exploit: Alarm lasts 8 hours and alerts you mentally when triggered. With Glyph of Warding, you can store it permanently. Now you've got magical doorbells or infinite security cameras.

### **🛏 *Tiny Servant \+ Furniture \= Haunted House Attack***

Exploit: Cast Tiny Servant on a chair or cabinet. It becomes animated for 8 hours. Let the furniture fight your battles or stage a ghost hoax. Bonus: animate a bed and ride it around like Aladdin.

### **🧼 *Unseen Servant – Infinite Butler Exploits***

Exploit: Unseen Servant can manipulate objects, open doors, and carry things. Use it to trigger traps, deliver poison, or pour wine while you monologue like a villain.

---

## **Rules Arbitration Busters & DM Headache Triggers**

---

### **Rule 1: *"The DM is always right"  \-  But only when they actually enforce it***

Exploit: Exploit inconsistent rulings by taking advantage of the "spirit of the rules" when the DM forgets or contradicts themselves. If they don't catch your edge-case, run with it.

### **Rule 2: *Infinite Action Loops***

Exploit: Combining *Haste*, *Action Surge*, *Ready* actions, and *bonus actions* (via feats or class features) can create absurd loops. RAW doesn't always say how many actions can be readied and triggered simultaneously. Find the chain and break the action economy.

### **Rule 3: *"You can cast spells while grappling if you don't use a spell attack or require somatic components"***

Exploit: Use spells that require only verbal or material components (without somatic) while grappled to keep control, stunlock, or debuff opponents without letting go.

### **Rule 4: *Healing Overflow & Potion Glut***

Exploit: Use the combination of *Healer* feat, potions, and abilities like *Song of Rest* to infinitely boost HP or remove conditions. Take turns chugging potions mid-combat to cheese fights.

### **Rule 5: *Talk Yourself Out of the Dungeon***

Exploit: Abuse social skill checks, combined with *Friends* cantrip and *Vicious Mockery*, to demoralize NPCs and avoid combat entirely  \-  or turn enemies into your unwitting allies.

### **Rule 6: *Corner Case Language in Feats***

Exploit: Take feats like *Lucky* or *Shield Master* to "bend" initiative or saving throws, or use *Sentinel* and *Polearm Master* for forced reaction damage every turn.

### **Rule 7: *Rule Zero for Maximum Chaos***

Exploit: Use the vague "Rule Zero" principle itself as a weapon: threaten to call out inconsistent rulings or demand explicit rules on the spot, slowing down the game and grinding the table to a halt.

### **Rule 8: *Stacking Conditions for Maximum Debuff***

Exploit: Stack effects like *Frightened*, *Restrained*, *Prone*, and *Grappled* in combinations that don't explicitly state they override or cancel each other, effectively locking down foes for multiple rounds.

### **Rule 9: *Long Rest Abuse***

Exploit: Exploit the RAW wording on long rests to repeatedly gain all spell slots, class features, and hit points with minimal downtime. Combine with *Teleporter* or *Spell Scroll* to bypass travel or encounter limits.

Friendly reminder: the best exploits often live in the gray area between written rules and DM interpretation\!
